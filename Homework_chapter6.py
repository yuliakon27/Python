# 6-11. Cities: Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as
# keys in your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and
# include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact
# about that city. The keys for each city’s dictionary should be something like
# country, population, and fact. Print the name of each city and all of the information
# you have stored about it.
